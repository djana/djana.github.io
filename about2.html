                        <h2>The GEOIDEA.RO Project</h2>
                        <p>Geoidea.ro stands for GEodata Openness Initative for Development and Economic Advancement in ROmania and 
                            started in January 2013. It aims at improving the scientific basis for open geodata model adoption in Romania. 
                            This project is co-financed by a grant from Switzerland through the Swiss Contribution to the enlarged 
                            European Union via the Swiss-Romanian Cooperation Programme.</p>
                        <p>It is planned to develop innovative technologies and tools for geodata publishing 
                            and retrieval as well as a common methodology for open data publishing. Further, the project will explore the 
                            possibilities to lower the costs of open geodata publication. This geoportal is still at the propotype stage and 
                            for demonstration purposes only.</p>
                        <p>The Geoportal Lite of the GEOIDEA.RO project is a lighter version that allows the users to have access to a few 
                            of the most important functions of the geoportal without a complicated interface. These consists of viewing and examples of 
                            WMS integration in third parties livraries.</p>
                       <p>You can find the full-fledge geoportal of the GEOIDEA.RO project <a href="http://geoidea.ethz.ch" target="_blank ">here</a>.</p>

                        <h3>Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation (IKG) at ETH Zürich</h3>
                        <p> The former Institute of Cartography was founded in 1925 by Professor Eduard Imhof, one of the main founders of modern 
                            academic cartography. Traditionally, research has focused on topographic cartography (relief representation), thematic 
                            cartography, and atlas cartography (school atlases, national atlases). These domains are still considered the main fields of 
                            application, but adapted to new demands, media and technologies. In 2011, with the establishment of the new chair of Geoinformation 
                            Engineering, the scope of activities of the institute was expanded and its name was adapted.<p>
                         <p>In cartography, under the leadership of Prof. Hurni, the institute strives to maintain its leading position by exploiting and 
                             further developing cartographic knowledge and adapting it to new interactive technologies and application domains.
                        </p>

                        <p>Research at CCIAS (the Groundwater Engineering Research Centre focuses on the characterization of permeable media 
                            using hydraulic and hydrochemical data and on the human impact on groundwater. </p>
                        <p> Applications include groundwater resources evaluation, urban groundwater, groundwater-infrastructure interaction, 
                            aquifer management, vulnerability assessment, ground pollution control, underground waste storage, and vadose zone analysis. 
                            Methods used are both regional and local in scale, of a quantitative nature, using flow and contaminant transport modeling. 
                            One part of the group develops geospatial data analysis and representation techniques and another one part works in data acquisition.
                        </p>  
                        <p>The Romanian team of the project has worked promoting the concept of open geodata in Romania as well as help with some data processing.</p>
